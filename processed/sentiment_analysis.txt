Comment: - The gymnasium scene, after they learned of the Horishima bombing. This was Nolan directing a horror film. First of all I loved the use of a wide open aperture during this scene, as it gave the scene a very shallow depth of field, resulting in a dream like/nightmare like appearance. This might be Cillian's best scene in the film, watching Oppenheimer dissociate from the jubilation of the crowd, as the reality around him begins to break down, as the destruction and death he was responsible for begins to truly sink in. I love how flat his "rah-rah" speech is. And the use of sound here is tremendous. The stamping of the feet, the sound of the crowd going out, the sound of a woman screaming, the crowd noise slamming back in like a bomb itself.

Comment: - **"You can use a shovel for atomic energy, in fact you do"** I loved that this film used a Rashomon style narrative where we see the same scene over and over again from different perspectives and subjectivity. One of my favorites was the scene where Oppenheimer "humiliates" Strauss in public over the isotopes. I love when we first see this scene, Strauss appears to take Oppenheimer's jabs with good humor, smiling and shrugging it off, but when the true nature of Strauss is revealed near the end of the film, we see this sequence again, and Strauss looks so angry and humiliated. Also Cillian's line delivery during these moments were so good. I just love how he says "in fact you do!"

Comment: - The final scene where we learn what Oppenheimer and Einstein really said to each other that day. Nolan understands set up and pay off so well. You watch the film waiting for the reveal and it does not disappoint. The final moment with the vision of the nuclear holocaust, is incredibly bleak, but much of what Einstein says to Oppenheimer during before this is so sad and god damn poignant. Watching Oppenheimer as an old man receive a hollow award and receive handshakes and pats on the back from some of the men that stabbed him in the back or attempted to. The way Einstein sums up the burden of genius, but also the way you will be taken for granted as you age. Processed
